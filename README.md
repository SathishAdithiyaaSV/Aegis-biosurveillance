# 🛡️ Aegis Biosurveillance Platform 🛡️

**Project Status: Prototype v1.0**

Aegis Biosurveillance is a **Real-time AI-Powered Threat Monitoring** and decision-support system utilizing a **One Health** framework to integrate human, animal, and environmental data streams.

## Key Features

* **Integrated National Threat Score:** A single, composite score (e.g., 68 - Moderate) reflecting the overall national health security posture.
* **Real-time Case and Hotspot Tracking:** Daily updates on new cases, population at risk, and the count of active local hotspots.
* **Syndrome Trend Analysis:** 8-week historical and current data visualization for key syndrome groups (e.g., Respiratory, Gastrointestinal).
* **AI Threat Spectrum Analysis:** Predictive modeling of current top health threats (e.g., Influenza A (H3N2), Norovirus, RSV) with risk percentages and geographic focus.
* **Vaccine Optimization Module:** Resource management tool for vaccine efficacy, current stockpiles, and monthly production capacity. **(Action: "Generate Strategic Plan" button)**
* **Multi-Domain Alerts:** Comprehensive monitoring across four critical sectors:
    1.  **Active Alerts:** Critical and high-priority human outbreaks (e.g., Unseasonal Influenza A Spike, Norovirus Outbreak).
    2.  **Zoonotic Surveillance:** Monitoring animal-to-human risk (e.g., Avian Influenza H5N1).
    3.  **Wastewater & Environmental Risk:** Early warning signals from community sewage and environmental samples (e.g., Poliovirus Traces).
    4.  **Wildlife Disease Surveillance:** Tracking pathogens in wild populations (e.g., CWD, African Swine Fever).
    5.  **Natural Disasters & Health Risks:** Assessment of disaster events and their associated public health consequences (e.g., Hurricane, Wildfire).

## Intended Use

The platform is designed for **public health officials, national security agencies, and healthcare system administrators** to make rapid, data-informed decisions regarding resource allocation, containment strategies, and public health advisories.
